Itâ€™s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
